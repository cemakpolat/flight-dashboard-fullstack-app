# Flight Data Producer

This project simulates a flight data producer that publishes data to an MQTT broker. It generates random flight information (flight ID, altitude, fuel level, status, etc.) and sends it to a specified MQTT topic at a configurable interval.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   Docker (recommended)
*   Docker Compose (recommended)

## Installation (Local Python Environment - Not Recommended)

**Note:** Using Docker is the recommended way to run this project. The instructions below are provided for local execution but may require more manual setup and dependency management.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    You can set environment variables directly in your shell (e.g., using `export` on Linux/macOS or `$env:` on PowerShell) or create a `.env` file in the project directory:

    ```
    MQTT_BROKER=broker.emqx.io
    MQTT_PORT=1883
    MQTT_TOPIC=flights/topic
    MESSAGE_SENDING_INTERVAL=10
    CITIES=NewYork,London,Paris
    ```

5.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py  # Replace with the actual script name
    ```

## Installation and Execution (Using Docker Compose - Recommended)

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file:**  This file should list all the Python dependencies required by your script (e.g., `paho-mqtt`). If you don't have any, you'll still need to create an empty `requirements.txt`

3.  **Create a `Dockerfile`:**  Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.  Use the following content:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    COPY . .

    CMD ["python", "your_script_name.py"] # Replace with your script's name
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `your_script_name.py` in the `Dockerfile` with the *actual* name of your Python script.

4.  **Configure environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:** Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to set the desired values for `MQTT_BROKER`, `MQTT_PORT`, `MQTT_TOPIC`, `MESSAGE_SENDING_INTERVAL`, and `CITIES`.

    ```yaml
    version: "3.9"
    services:
      flight-data-producer:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        volumes:
          - .:/app
        environment:
          - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
          - MQTT_BROKER=broker.emqx.io
          - MQTT_PORT=1883
          - MQTT_TOPIC=flights/topic
          - MESSAGE_SENDING_INTERVAL=10
          - CITIES=NewYork,London,Paris,Tokyo,Sydney,Dubai,Berlin,Rome,Madrid,Toronto,LosAngeles,Chicago,Houston,Phoenix,Philadelphia,SanAntonio,SanDiego,Dallas,SanJose,Austin
        depends_on:
          []
        restart: always

      mqtt-broker:
        image: eclipse-mosquitto:latest
        ports:
          - "1883:1883"
    ```

5.  **Build and run the application:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

6.  **Stop the application:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be used to configure the application:

*   `MQTT_BROKER`: The address of the MQTT broker.  Defaults to `broker.emqx.io`.
*   `MQTT_PORT`: The port of the MQTT broker. Defaults to `1883`.
*   `MQTT_TOPIC`: The MQTT topic to publish data to. Defaults to `flights/topic`.
*   `MESSAGE_SENDING_INTERVAL`: The interval (in seconds) between sending messages. Defaults to `10`.
*   `CITIES`: A comma-separated list of cities used for generating flight data. Defaults to a list of major cities.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Connection errors:** Verify that the MQTT broker is running and accessible from your machine or Docker container. Check the `MQTT_BROKER` and `MQTT_PORT` configuration.
*   **Missing dependencies:** If running locally, ensure that all required Python packages are installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If running with Docker, check the `Dockerfile` and ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly.
*   **Docker build errors:** Check the `Dockerfile` for any syntax errors or missing files. Make sure the `context` in the `docker-compose.yml` file is set correctly.
*   **No data published:** Verify the MQTT topic and ensure that a subscriber is listening to the topic. Check the application logs for any errors.

**Medium Blog Post (Draft)**

**Title: Simulating Real-Time Flight Data with Python and Docker Compose**

---

**Introduction**

In today's data-driven world, the ability to generate and process real-time data streams is essential for many applications.  This post will guide you through creating a simple flight data producer using Python and publishing the data to an MQTT broker.  We'll also leverage Docker Compose to containerize our application and simplify deployment.

**What is MQTT?**

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight messaging protocol that's ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) and real-time data streaming.  It uses a publish-subscribe model, where clients publish messages to topics, and other clients subscribe to those topics to receive the messages.

**Building the Flight Data Producer (Python)**

We'll start by creating a Python script that generates random flight data, including flight IDs, altitudes, fuel levels, status, and more. This script uses the `paho-mqtt` library to connect to an MQTT broker and publish the generated data.

```python
# (Paste your Python code here)
```

**Explanation of the Python Code:**

*   The script uses the `paho-mqtt` library to interact with the MQTT broker.
*   It generates random flight data using the `generate_flight_data()` function.  You can customize this function to generate more realistic or specific data.
*   The `publish_data()` function serializes the data to JSON and publishes it to the specified MQTT topic.
*   Environment variables (like `MQTT_BROKER`, `MQTT_PORT`, `MQTT_TOPIC`, etc.) are used to configure the script, making it easy to adapt to different environments.

**Containerizing with Docker Compose**

Docker Compose simplifies the process of building and running multi-container applications. We'll create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define our application stack, which includes the flight data producer and an optional MQTT broker.

```yaml
# (Paste your docker-compose.yml code here)
```

**Key elements of the `docker-compose.yml` file:**

*   **`flight-data-producer` service:** This defines the container for our Python script.  It specifies the `build` context (the location of the `Dockerfile`), the environment variables to configure the script, and any dependencies.
*   **`mqtt-broker` service (optional):** This defines a container for the MQTT broker.  It uses the `eclipse-mosquitto` image, which provides a lightweight and easy-to-use MQTT broker.

**Creating the Dockerfile**

A `Dockerfile` is used to define the steps required to build the Docker image for our flight data producer.

```dockerfile
# (Paste your Dockerfile code here)
```

**Running the Application**

1.  **Create `requirements.txt` :** If you don't have one you must create a file called `requirements.txt` in the same directory as your script and docker-compose.yml file.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
4.  **Run `docker-compose up --build`**

**Observing the Data**

To see the data being published, you can subscribe to the MQTT topic using an MQTT client like MQTTX, Mosquitto CLI, or any other MQTT client of your choice.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to create a simple flight data producer using Python, publish data to an MQTT broker, and containerize the application with Docker Compose. This approach allows for flexible and scalable real-time data simulation, making it useful for testing and development purposes. By leveraging environment variables and Docker, you can easily adapt this project to different environments and integrate it into larger systems.
